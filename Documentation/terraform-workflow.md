# Terraform Workflow

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. Its workflow consists of the following key steps:

## 1. Write
Begin by writing the configuration files using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). These files define the desired state of your infrastructure, detailing the required resources and their configurations.

## 2. Init
Execute `terraform init` to initialize the directory containing the Terraform configuration files. This command prepares the directory for Terraform operations, sets up the appropriate backend, and installs necessary plugins (providers).

## 3. Plan
Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that Terraform intends to make to the infrastructure. This step helps you verify that the proposed changes align with your expectations and do not disrupt existing services.

## 4. Apply
Use `terraform apply` to apply the changes specified in the plan. Upon confirmation, Terraform will provision and manage the infrastructure as defined, moving your environment to the desired state.

## 5. Destroy
To dismantle all resources created by Terraform, use `terraform destroy`. This command directs Terraform to remove the managed resources, effectively cleaning up the infrastructure.

This structured workflow allows teams to manage their infrastructure as code, providing clear configuration documentation and facilitating automation and collaboration.
